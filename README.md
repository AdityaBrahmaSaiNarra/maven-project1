This is a sample Java Project which will create a login page

We can use maven as a build tool to build with maven commands

we can use package as maven command

We have to configure this project on tomcat9 server 

so that is the reason we need to install deploy on container plugin 

This plugin will help you to deploy this artifact which will be generated in the work space

we need to configure tomcat-users.xml to give certain privilages to deploy that artifact
